# Pretrained Language Model

This repository provides the latest pretrained language models and its related optimization techniques developed by Huawei Noah's Ark Lab.

## Directory structure
* [PanGu-α](https://github.com/huawei-noah/Pretrained-Language-Model/tree/master/PanGu-α) is a 200B parameter autoregressive pretrained Chinese language model.
* [NEZHA-TensorFlow](https://github.com/huawei-noah/Pretrained-Language-Model/tree/master/NEZHA-TensorFlow) is a pretrained Chinese language model which achieves the state-of-the-art performances on several Chinese NLP tasks developed by TensorFlow.
* [NEZHA-PyTorch](https://github.com/huawei-noah/Pretrained-Language-Model/tree/master/NEZHA-PyTorch) is the PyTorch version of NEZHA.
* [NEZHA-Gen-TensorFlow](https://github.com/huawei-noah/Pretrained-Language-Model/tree/master/NEZHA-Gen-TensorFlow) provides two GPT models. One is Yuefu (乐府), a Chinese Classical Poetry generation model, the other is a common Chinese GPT model.
* [TinyBERT](https://github.com/huawei-noah/Pretrained-Language-Model/tree/master/TinyBERT) is a compressed BERT model which achieves 7.5x smaller and 9.4x faster on inference.
* [TinyBERT-MindSpore](https://github.com/huawei-noah/Pretrained-Language-Model/tree/master/TinyBERT-MindSpore) is a MindSpore version of TinyBERT.
* [DynaBERT](https://github.com/huawei-noah/Pretrained-Language-Model/tree/master/DynaBERT) is a dynamic BERT model with adaptive width and depth.
* [BBPE](https://github.com/huawei-noah/Pretrained-Language-Model/tree/master/BBPE) provides a byte-level vocabulary building tool and its correspoinding tokenizer.
* [PMLM](https://github.com/huawei-noah/Pretrained-Language-Model/tree/master/PMLM) is an improved method for pretrained language model. Trained without the complex two-stream self-attention, PMLM can be treated as a simple approximation of XLNet.
* [TernaryBERT](https://github.com/huawei-noah/Pretrained-Language-Model/tree/master/TernaryBERT) is a pytorch version quantization method for BERT model.
* [HyperText](https://github.com/huawei-noah/Pretrained-Language-Model/tree/master/HyperText) is an efficient text classification model using hyperbolic geometry theories.
* [SumTitles](https://github.com/huawei-noah/Pretrained-Language-Model/tree/master/SumTitles) is a summarization corpus with low extractivity.
